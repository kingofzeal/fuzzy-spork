I recently ordered a couple books after seeming them recommended a couple times - [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592) and [The Unicorn Project](https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Project-Developers-Disruption-Thriving-ebook/dp/B07QT9QR41).

Both books center around a single company and time during a transformational series of events within their IT structure, but each book focuses on a different part of the company, and as such are intended for slightly different audiences. The Phoenix Project is written from the perspective of an IT Manager (specifically, the acting CIO), while The Unicorn Project is written from the perspective of a developer.

To say I enjoyed these books is an understatement. I finished each of them in under twenty-four hours, and it was difficult to focus on much else. Even knowing how the overall story ended did not diminish my enjoyment of the second book due to the radically different natures and perspectives of the story.

As much as I enjoyed the books, they also forced me to reflect on my own situation, the companies I have worked with, and tried to see if I could identify the same types of issues (perhaps on a smaller scale) as those pointed out in these books. While I'm glad to say that I haven't seen as many things as are told throughout the stories, there are still some painful similarities.

It also forced me to evaluate who I most closely identify with, and how _that_ aligns with my own career and where I want to be. And, perhaps more detrimental, I also find myself comparing my coworkers, both current and former - to the various characters. And seeing that characterization also defines my own analysis of who I relate with - perhaps who we all want to relate with, which I think is one of the primary goals of these books.

One thing I'm starting to realize is that, as much as I love software development, I feel like I truly enjoy making people more efficient - regardless if those people are customers or coworkers. I enjoy solving problems that may or may not have anything to do with a direct customer concern. 

One thing a mentor told me, which has stuck with me, is that the biggest gain a developer can make for a company is to automate things, but that's not necessarily the whole picture. Automation does help, but it's also just another tool in the toolbox to being more efficient.
